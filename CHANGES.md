# Changes Made to Employee Registration Process

## Issue Addressed
1. Removed the need to pass token from frontend
2. Added linking between User and Employee entities
3. Improved error handling and validation

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified EmployeeRegisterRequest
- Removed token field from the request object
- Frontend now only needs to send email and password

### 2. Enhanced EmployeeInviteTokenRepository
- Added method to find tokens by employee email
- Query finds the latest valid token for an employee that hasn't been used for account creation

### 3. Updated EmployeeRegisterService
- Modified to find invitation tokens using email instead of token
- Added comprehensive error handling for various scenarios:
  - No invitation found for email
  - Employee exists but invitation expired/invalid
  - Token expired
  - Token already used
  - Email mismatch
- Now links User and Employee entities bidirectionally
- Properly marks token as used and sets confirmation timestamp

### 4. Enhanced Employee Entity
- Added OneToOne relationship with User entity
- Created database migration for the user_id column

## Benefits
- Simplified API for frontend (only email and password needed)
- Complete user profile with linked entities (User and Employee)
- Improved security with comprehensive validation
- Better user experience with more specific error messages
- Proper database integrity with bidirectional relationships
